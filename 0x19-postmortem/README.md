# Postmortem


## Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (GMT) on January 15, 2024.
Impact: The user authentication service experienced a complete outage during this period. Users were unable to log in to their accounts, resulting in a 30% decrease in overall user activity on the platform.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an overload on the authentication servers and subsequent failure.

## Timeline:

10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.
10:05 AM: Engineering team notified of the issue and began investigation.
10:20 AM: Initial assumption was made that the issue might be related to database performance. Database servers were inspected for any anomalies.
10:45 AM: Realized that the issue was not database-related. Load balancer configurations were checked for discrepancies.
11:15 AM: Identified the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings causing uneven distribution of traffic.
11:30 AM: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for further assistance.
12:00 PM: Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among authentication servers.
12:30 PM: User authentication service restored to normal operation.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was traced to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic to the authentication servers.
To resolve the issue, the load balancer configurations were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among the authentication servers, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve load balancer configuration management practices to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Implement automated monitoring and alerting systems to detect load balancer configuration discrepancies in real-time.
Conduct regular audits of critical infrastructure components to identify and address potential points of failure.

## Tasks:
Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations and implement standardized templates to prevent misconfigurations.
Develop and implement automated tests to validate load balancer configurations against predefined criteria before deployment.
Enhance internal documentation and training materials to educate team members on best practices for load balancer management.
